# Eight-Queens
Solution for the Eight Queens Problem (generalised to N Queens) using different algorithms


The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3

The solution provided is based on two programming approaches: Recursive Method and Iterative Method.
Both of my solutions fare equally well compared to each other.

The options that can be used in the programs are:

1. The 8 by 8 Problem is solved generally for N by N chess board. Hence you can specify the dimensions of the board for which you desire the solutions.
2. You can specify whether you are happy with one solution on the board, or you would like to get all the solutions.
3. Accordingly, the program will print all the boards and/or give the total number of solutions it found.

The total number of solutions found by the program matches with total number of solutions that exist for that board. Meaning the program successfully finds all the possible solutions for a given dimension of chess board. I have been able to verify this for upto a 17 by 17 board on my computer.

When looking for one possible solution I have been able to find a solution for upto a 33 by 33 board. Beyond that the program takes reasonably large time to calculate a solution on my computer. 

Maybe you have a faster computer, and can run the program for a larger board. OR have a more optimized approach in solving the problem :)
